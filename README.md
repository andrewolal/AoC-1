Solutions to Advent of Code

## 2020
First year I solved all problems, first year I upload my solutions.
All solved on my mediocre phone using [Termux](https://termux.com), [ViM](https://www.vim.org/) and of course the [J902 on Android](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/System/Installation/J902).
The solutions expect inputs in files named as "2020-x.txt" where x is the day number.
The days variable contains all day numbers (1-25) to be executed when 2020.ijs is loaded.
